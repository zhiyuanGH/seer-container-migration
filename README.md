# Seer Container Migration

Seer Container Migration is a tool designed to perform efficient container migrations. This tool is part of the Seer framework and provides methods to predict file accesses during container execution and migrate containers in low-bandwidth environments. The core functionality allows you to migrate containers seamlessly between different environments, preserving state and configurations.

## Features

- **Seamless Migration**: Migrates containers efficiently between source and destination environments.
- **File Access Prediction**: Predicts file access during container execution to minimize unnecessary data transfer.
- **Low-Bandwidth Optimization**: Optimizes migration traffic, reducing network overhead in constrained environments.
- **Flexible Integration**: Easily integrates with container platforms like Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allowing easy extensions for other platforms and migration strategies.

## Requirements

- **Go**: Version 1.18 or higher.
- **Docker**: For managing containers.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating container migrations (if applicable).
- **Redis**: For monitoring and controlling migration state in certain components.
- **External Dependencies**: Managed through the Go modules (`go.mod` and `go.sum`).

## Installation

Follow these steps to install Seer Container Migration:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zhiyuanGH/seer-container-migration.git
   cd seer-container-migration

2. Compile:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy 
   go mod vendor
   make && make install

## Usage

Follow these steps to use Seer to migrate your containers:

1.Launch the Seer agent on both the source node and the destination node:
    ```bash
    seerserver

2.Migrate the container:
    ```bash
    seer -dst [the IP and port of seerserver of the destination node] -src [the IP and port of seerserver of the source node] -container [name of the container]
